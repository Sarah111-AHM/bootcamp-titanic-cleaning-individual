# Advanced Titanic Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

## Project Background
This project was completed independently during my training with ZAKey Bootcamp. 
All data cleaning, feature engineering, and documentation decisions were made by me.

## Objective
To transform the messy Titanic dataset into a clean, AI-ready dataset, 
handling missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, outliers, and creating new features for analysis or modeling.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning & preprocessing with Pandas
- Handling missing data via imputation or deletion
- Removing duplicates and standardizing formats
- Feature engineering and outlier management
- Documenting reproducible data pipelines

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab
