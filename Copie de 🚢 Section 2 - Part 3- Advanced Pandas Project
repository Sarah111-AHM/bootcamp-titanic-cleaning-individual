The dataset includes columns like `PassengerId`, `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`, with challenges like missing values, duplicates, and outliers. Complete four tasks to produce a cleaned dataset.\n","\n","**Getting Started**:\n","- Open a new Colab notebook.\n","- Import Pandas: `import pandas as pd`.\n","- Load the dataset: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv`.\n","- Use `display()` to view DataFrames.\n","- Save to Google Drive to preserve progress.\n","\n","**Context**:\n","The Titanic dataset is a data science staple, with missing `Age` (20% missing) and `Cabin` (77% missing) values, potential duplicates, and varied formats. Enhancing it prepares you for AI tasks like survival prediction.\n","\n","**Tips for Success**:\n","- Use `df.info()` to check missing values and data types.\n","- Preview data with `df.head()` to spot issues.\n","- Work on a copy (`df.copy()`) to preserve the original.\n","- Save intermediate results to streamline debugging.\n","- Explore Pandas documentation (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for methods.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Task 1: Handle Missing Data\n","Load the Titanic dataset and address missing values in `Age`, `Cabin`, and `Embarked`.

Display the cleaned DataFrame.\n","\n","**Why This Task?**:\n","Missing data can bias analyses or AI models. The median is robust for `Age`, dropping `Cabin` avoids unreliable imputation, and the mode suits `Embarked` for categorical data.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","import pandas as pd\n","url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv\"\n","df = pd.read_csv(url)\n","df['Age'] = df['Age'].fillna(df['Age'].median())\n","df = df.drop(columns=['Cabin'])\n","df['Embarked'] = df['Embarked'].fillna(df['Embarked'].mode()[0])\n","display(df)\n","```\n","\n","**Expected Output**:\n","A DataFrame with no missing values in `Age` or `Embarked`, no `Cabin` column, and at least 891 rows."],"metadata":{"id":"a7dHBlEFVldn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["print(df_clean.columns)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"XyPuQfgcA32z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1758386692556,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":894,"user":{"displayName":"ساره أحمد عودة ابو منديل","userId":"06415661594324235524"}},"outputId":"646849a4-b65a-4ef3-90dc-257cc7b00c5f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Index(['PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp',\n","       'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Embarked', 'Age_imputed', 'Deck',\n","       'Embarked_imputed'],\n","      dtype='object')\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Task 1: Handle Missing Data\n","# -

represent total family members aboard, including the passenger. Then, identify and handle outliers in `Fare` using a method of your choice (e.g., IQR, z-score, or capping). Document your outlier method and justification in a Markdown cell below your code. Display the final DataFrame.\n","\n","**Why This Task?**:\n","Feature engineering, like `FamilySize`, adds meaningful variables for analysis or AI modeling. Handling outliers in `Fare` prevents skewed results, and choosing your method encourages creativity and critical thinking.\n","\n","**Example**:\n","```python\n","# Create FamilySize\n","df['FamilySize'] = df['SibSp'] + df['Parch'] + 1\n","\n","# Handle Fare outliers using IQR\n","Q1 = df['Fare'].quantile(0.25)\n","Q3 = df['Fare'].quantile(0.75)\n","IQR = Q3 - Q1\n","lower_bound = Q1 - 1.5 * IQR\n","upper_bound = Q3 + 1.5 * IQR\n","df['Fare'] = df['Fare'].clip(lower=lower_bound, upper=upper_bound)\n","display(df)\n","```\n","\n","```markdown\n","**Outlier Method and Justification**:\n","I used the IQR method to cap `Fare` outliers at 1.5 times the interquartile range below Q1 and above Q3. This approach is robust for non-normal data like `Fare`, which is right-skewed.
